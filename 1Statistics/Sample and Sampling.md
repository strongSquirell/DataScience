_Sample_ - subset of a population.  
_Representative sample_ - a microversion of the entire population.  
__Simple random sample__ - each subject has same chance of being selected. 
  * make clear what the population lools like
  * sampling frame, compile a list of subjects
  * randomly choose sample
  * approach respondents (face-to-face, telephone, self-administraned quastionaire)  
_Possible bias_
  * undercoverage - not everyone in the population is included in sampling frame
  * sampling bias - not every person in your sampling frame is equally likely to be included in the sample(convenience sample)
  * nonresponse bias
  * response bias 
first 3 - estimation will be biased due to systematic under- or over- reperesentation of certain groups,
last - systematic misrepresentation of response

__Random multi-stage cluster sample__
  * first you identify a large number of clusters within your population, every cluster is represented by a bucket
  * randomly pick number of bucket
  * sample - random selection of clusters


__Stratified random sample__
  * divide a population into separate groups, which you call strata
  * select a simple random sample from each strata
  * obtain sample

__Bigger is better__
but bigger sample can never make up for a bad sampling procedure

_Sample distribution of the sample mean_ is the distribution that you get if you draw an infinite number of samples from your population and compute the mean of all collected sample means.

_Central limit theorem_ provided that the sample size is sufficiently large, the sample distribution of the sample mean has an approximately normal distribution

mu_x = mu population, sigma_x = sigma/sqrt(n) (n >= 30)  
mu_p = pi, sigma_p = sqrt(p(1-p)/n)           (at least 15 positive, 15 negative) (binary cathegorical variables)

1. Population distribution
2. Data/Sample distribution
3. Sampling distribution - theoretical distribution

__Sample size__
  * magnitute of desired margin of error(smaller margin - larger sample)
  * confidence level                    (larger         - larger)
  * variability of data                 (larger         - larger)
    * _mean_  
n = sigma^2*z^2/m^2  
sigma - from educated guess or previous research
    * _proportion_  
n = p(1-p)*z^2/m^2  
p -  from educated guess or previous research or 0.25
