# Getting and cleaning data
This folder contains information how to get and clean data in R and Python.

__Data__ are values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items.

The 4 things you should have:
  * The raw data
  * A tidy data set
  * A code book describing each variable and its values in the tidy data set
  * An explicit an exact recipe you used to go from the raw data to the tidy data set

The tidy data:
  1. Each variable you measure should be in one column
  2. Each different observation of that variable should be in a different row
  3. There should be one table for each kind of variable
  4. If you have multiple tables, they should include a column in the table that allows them to be linked
