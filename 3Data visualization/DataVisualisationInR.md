# Exloratory data analysis in R

_Principles of Analytic Graphics_
  * Show comparison
  * Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
  * Show multivariate data
  * Integration of evidence
  * Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.
  * Content is king

_Why do we use graphs in data analysis?_
  * to understand data properties
  * to find patterns in data
  * to suggest modeling strategies
  * to "debug" analysis
  * to communicate results

__Simple summaries of data__  
_One dimension_
  * Five-number summary (summary())
  * Boxplot             (boxplot(x, col = ""))
  * Histograms          (hist(x, col = "", breaks = ); rug(x); abline(median(x)))
  * Density plot        (plot(density(x)))
  * Barplot             (barplot(y))
_Two dimensions_
  * Multiple/overlayed 1-D plots
  * Scatterplots
  * Smooth scatterplots
_> 2 simensions_
  * Overlayed/multiple 2-D plots; coplots
  * Use color, size, shap to add dimensions
  * Spinning plots
  * Actual 3-D plots
